3. Text Editors
===============

There are two main editors available for use through your terminal. Generally
they are based around the same concepts of providing you with easier text
editing through the use of shortcuts and macros

The two main editors are Vim and Emacs. There is a large dispute over which one
to use, which is "better" and so on. Rather than dive into that discussion here
I suggest you try out the "tutorial programs" of both and then pick one to learn
and use on a regular basis.

To run the vimtutor simply log in to a linux/unix machine and type in vimtutor
and follow the instructions.

To run the emacs tutorial, open emacs and figure it out.
