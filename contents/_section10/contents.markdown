10. Screen/tmux
===============

Sick of tabs? Or are you using a shell environment that doesnâ€™t support them?
Welcome to the world of screen. Screen gives you different windows within the
same development environment. You can work on running multiple processes all
from the same shell. Itâ€™s great if youâ€™re running a command that takes a lot of
time to execute and you still want to do some more stuff.
