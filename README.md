1. Do some fancy javascript hides on the stuff that should be hidden / not
Make those things also cookie themselves so people dont have to re-hide things all the time<br>
2. Do something about the lack of good footer/headers<br>
3. Index page for the sections in each course<br>
3. Create better Linux tutorials, move some things to advanced<br>
