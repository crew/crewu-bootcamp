TODO:  
1. Do some fancy javascript hides on the stuff that should be hidden / not
Make those things also cookie themselves so people dont have to re-hide things all the time  
2. Do something about the lack of good footer/headers  
3. Create better Linux tutorials, move some things to advanced (see categories below)  
4. Create a quiz for people to practice with (See crewu wiki, Jonathan has spencer's notes on this)  
5. Probably fix a lot of colors  
6. Dont introduce more frameworks
