1. FileSystems
1.1 Introduciton to filesystems, a few facts:
  1) There are 2 things, Files and Folders.
  2) These are arranged in a "tree" structure with folders containing more files & folders.
  3) The root folder is located at "/".
  4) A filepath is the list of folders needed to arrive at a particular point in the tree:
    "/home/fakeuser/documents/classes/"
  5) Your home directory is located at "/home/user".
     A shortcut for this is to use "~".

1.2 A couple more things:
  1) Adding a drive (USB, or other) to a filesystem is called "mounting" this just means that you add the drive as another branch on your tree at some point in the tree.
  2) Full paths are paths that start at the "root" of the filesystem ("/") and then go from there (you can use "~" to abreviate if you would like.
  3) Relative filepaths are ones that start at the directory you are in and go on from there.
  4) Unix filesystems have 2 folders inside every folder "." and ".." these are "this folder" and "the folder above" respectively. these are very helpful when needing to refer to folders or files that are near your current location in the filesystem.
  5) Unix filesystems hide files and folders from "normal" view by putting a "." at the begining of the name like this: ".config"

1.3 Other good to know things:
  Commands have flags, such as "-a" or "-r" these can be combined "-avz" or used sepparately "-avz -e" these flags alter the way that commnads you enter into your terminal opperate.
  Shells:
  There are several different shells that provide additional functionality to your linux experiance such as "tab completion" of commands and prompts, we will go into greater detail about shells later.


2. Basic Linux Commands
NOTE on notation:
command [flags can go here] <mandatory argument> [optional argument]
arguments and flag groups are sepparated by spaces


  ls [filepath]
  Used for:
    To list the contents of directories. Can be used on other directories, assumes you mean this one if no directory given.
  Flags:
    -a Lists all files (including hidden)
    -l Does the long output, listing permissions owner and size
    -h Makes output "human readable" (adjusts sizes from bytes to K, M, G etc.)
    -R Enables recursion into directories

  mkdir [file path/] <directory name>
  Used for:
    Making a directory.
  Flags:

  cd <file path>
  Used to change the directory you are currently in to the given one. Takes full or relative path
  Flags:

  touch [file path/] <file name>
  Used for:
    Creation of files.
  Flags:

  rm [flags] <file or directory>
  Used for:
    Removing files or directories.
  Flags:
    -r Recurs down into directories
    -f Force, ignores any complaints etc (will delete directories)
    -v Verbose, lists delted directories.

  mv [Path]<file or directory name> [path]<file or directory name>
  Used for:
    Copies the first file/direcotry and then places it in the second location.
  Flags:

  cp [Path]<file or directory name> [path]<file or directory name>
  Used for:
    Copying files.
  Flags:
    -r Activates recusion.
