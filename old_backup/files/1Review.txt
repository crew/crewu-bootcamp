 - What were the topics they did not cover you wanted to see

 - Would you prefer it to be more / less interactive
I wish it was possible to try typing commands, or add flags to comand.

 - What was better
        - New Feature(s)?
          - An image of the actual command is displayed how it would look in the terminal.
        
        - Old content, better Presentation?
          - One thing that was better was the examples it displays commands being called.
          - The other nice feature is just having a nice and easy explanation of what the command is. ex
"cd $DIR
change directory. Changes the current working directory to the directory $DIR. In effect, moves you around the computer."

 - What was worse
         - I dislike how the only thing ever put in the example is "$dir" instead of an example directory

        - Did Bootcamp cover this content?
          - All of this content was covered in the first class.

- Interesting Feature(s)? Diagrams, doodles etc?
          - at the bottom it gives two pieces of code that should never be run, and explains what they are and why they should never be run.
