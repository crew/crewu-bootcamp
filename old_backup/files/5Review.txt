This covers all the material you would want to cover in a "basic" tutorial / guide to using linux

Has a nice table of commands & their use at the end of each section

Things it does not cover:
    dotfiles
    minimal coverage of find
    covers grep, not egrep
    popd
    sudo !!
    who SU is
    screen
    text editors

Things it does cover
    gzip
    du (-hs)
    chomod (not chown)


overall quite comprehensive, very good starting point.
