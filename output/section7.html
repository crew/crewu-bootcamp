<ul>
<li><p>The first rule of sudo is don&#39;t sudo. Sudo the first rule of sudo is to sudo. 
Sudo allows you to act as the &quot;root&quot; user when interacting in your shell. The
&quot;root&quot; user is your computer. It controls permissions over everything, and is
the ultimate voice of authority over anything your computer does. It is actually
possible to login as a root user, and when you are acting as root your prompt
will change to have a hash (#). Being the root user is occasionally helpful when
you need to install programs, in that case you don&#39;t want to log in as the
root user, but just borrow its powers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sudo is a useful command for those wishing to make changes to configuration
files that are normally hidden from view and not editable. If you go to the
root directory (/) and do a &quot;ls&quot; &quot;-la&quot; you will see that most of the files are owned
by the &quot;root&quot; user and are lacking write permissions. These files are protected
by root because they are normally things that make your computer run, such as
background process that you probably don&#39;t want to mess with unless you want to brick your computer.</p>
