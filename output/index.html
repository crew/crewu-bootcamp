          <p><h1>What is CrewU and what is it for?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Crew as a whole works on projects for CCIS and provides a place for CCIS
students to get hands on experience working with lots of different
technologies. The problem with this is that many students who join Crew have
no prior experience working with any of these technologies. This is not in of
itself a problem, however we do need to provide an efficient way to get new
Crew members up to speed so that they can begin to participate in crew!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most learning is done by &quot;self teaching&quot; as most members will not have the
experience to teach the topic, though they may be able to answer specific
questions. Crew U is here to provide two things. One is a &quot;bootcamp&quot; to
get crew members up to speed on  the technologies that we use across all of our
projects. The second is essentially a FAQ with technologies that we use either
in our infrastructure, or on our projects with links to good resources about
those technologies as well as some basic information about them and what they
are used for.</p>
<p>This will hopefully provide an easier transition for new members into crew as
well as providing some structure for our &quot;crewgile&quot; development cycle.</p>
