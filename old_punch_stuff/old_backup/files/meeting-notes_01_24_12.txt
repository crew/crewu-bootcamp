What we did:
  Went over their goals & Goals for CrewU
    - Generally want to know how to use Linux
    - Some interest in web dev
  Ran a very basic version of bootcam
    ls, cd, mkdir, mv, cp, rm, arguments, unix directory structure
    Need much more before we can get really started.

Action Items:
  Run bootcamp with current members, need to get their linux skills up to where they can do things on their own.
  Gather information from all ex-bootcamp members on their "bootcamp experiance"
  Review Linux tutorials:
    - What was good?
    - What was bad?
    - What material is confusing?
    - Any cool graphics?
    - Any other interesting teaching tools?
  Create a basic outline of the material we need covered in the tutorial
    - Cover it with new memebrs.
