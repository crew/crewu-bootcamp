          <p>Crew as a whole works on projects for CCIS and provides a place for CCIS
          students to get hands on experience working with lots of different
          technologies. The problem with this is that many students who join Crew have
          no prior experience working with any of these technologies. This is not in of
          itself a problem, however we do need to provide an efficient way to get new
          Crew members up to speed so that they can begin to participate in crew!</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Most learning is done by <em>self teaching</em> as most members will not have the
        experience to teach the topic, though they may be able to answer specific
        questions. Crew U is here to provide two things. One is a "bootcamp" to
        get crew members up to speed on  the technologies that we use across all of our
        projects. The second is essentially a FAQ with technologies that we use either
        in our infrastructure, or on our projects with links to good resources about
        those technologies as well as some basic information about them and what they
        are used for.</p>

        <p>This will hopefully provide an easier transition for new members into crew as
        well as providing some structure for our <em>crewgile</em> development cycle.</p>
