<h3>Software versioning!</h3>

<p>When working on a project it is very important of course that you save your work. However what happens if something breaks and you need to go back? What if you need towork on the project with multiple people and need access to updated versions of each other's files?</p>

<p>This is where software versioning comes in. Software version control systems let you "commit" changes to files keeping track of the changes, allowing you to see what changes have been made by your team on a project, or revert to a previous state if necessary.</p>

<p>The software we use for this in crew is called Git. If you would like to learn how to use git please check out <a href="http://try.github.com/" title="try.github.com">this link</a>.</p>
