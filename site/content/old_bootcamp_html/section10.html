<h1>10. Screen/tmux</h1>

<p>Sick of tabs? Or are you using a shell environment that does not even support them?
Welcome to the world of screen. Screen gives you different windows within the
same development environment. You can work on running multiple processes all
from the same shell. It's great if you are running a command that takes a lot of
time to execute and you still want to do some more stuff.</p>

<p>Both screen and Tmux provide this functionality, generally their use is out of the scope of this tutorial, but we wanted to but a note here
for those of you that might be interested in learning more about them on your own.</p>
