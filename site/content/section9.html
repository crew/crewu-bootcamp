<h1>9. Shell scripting</h1>

<ul>
<li>Ever wanted to automate something? Have you been running the same set of commands all morning? Deleting your project, rebuilding your project, over and over again? This is where shellscripting comes into play. Shell scripts are just a series of commands executed from top to bottom by the shell intrpreter. As you already know there are several types of shells and shell interpreters but we will focus on scripting for the bash shell.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Two things to note:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The first line of the file tells the opperating system what interpreter you would like to execute your script. When scripting for bash this will be:
    #!/bin/bash</p></li>
<li><p>The second thing to note is that you will need permissions to exectue your file, this will mean running:
    chmod +x myshellscript.sh</p></li>
<li><p>To run your shellscript simply "dot-slash" it as below and watch the magic happen.
    ./myshellscript.sh</p></li>
</ul>
