<h1>7. Sudo</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>The first rule of sudo is don't sudo. Sudo the first rule of sudo is to sudo. 
Sudo allows you to act as the "root" user when interacting in your shell. The
"root" user is your computer. It controls permissions over everything, and is
the ultimate voice of authority over anything your computer does. It is actually
possible to login as a root user, and when you are acting as root your prompt
will change to have a hash (#). Being the root user is occasionally helpful when
you need to install programs, in that case you don't want to log in as the
root user, but just borrow its powers.</p></li>
<li><p>Sudo is a useful command for those wishing to make changes to configuration
files that are normally hidden from view and not editable. If you go to the
root directory (/) and do a "ls" "-la" you will see that most of the files are owned
by the "root" user and are lacking write permissions. These files are protected
by root because they are normally things that make your computer run, such as
background process that you probably don't want to mess with unless you want to brick your computer.</p></li>
