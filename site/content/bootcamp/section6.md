# 6. Shells & Customization

## Shells!

### Bourne Again Shell

Bourne Again Shell (Bash) is a shell that is provided on almost all
distributions of linux and unix. Bash is the go-to shell when you are making
shell scripts. However, Bash's interactive mode is not quite as nice as some
other shells.

### Z Shell

One shell that has an excellent set of interactive features is Zshell this
shell comes with a much smarter autocomplete, a promt that supports colors,
and can be customized to interact accordingly with certain version control
software, as well as a spellcheck feature for most of you basic shell commands

## Customization!

Customization of many of your interactive shell programs, vim, emacs, your
shell itself are controlled by files in your home directory called "dotfiles".
These files are the way that you customize how your shell's promot looks,
where it checks for autocomplete, shortened names for commands and much much
more.

Configuring these dotfiles is an artform all on its own, below I have included
some links to Zshell's documentation as well as a link to a package of
dotfiles managed by Thoughtbot. These dotfiles are very easy to install and
are a great way to get yourself kick started into customizing your linux
terminal experiance.
