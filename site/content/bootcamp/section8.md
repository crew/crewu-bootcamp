# 8. Apt-get

apt-get is a useful Ubuntu Linux command that is used for getting packages to
install on Linux. It's really simple. Apt-get install cowsay. It will prompt
you to confirm the amount of space it will use, run an install script, and
BAM. You just installed a program on Linux.

As mentioned in the previous section you will need to be root in order to
install programs
